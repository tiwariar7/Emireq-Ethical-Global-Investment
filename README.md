# Emireq - Ethical Global Investment

A single static product page designed to answer the core question: "Why should someone trust this investment?" with a focus on clarity, transparency, and honest presentation.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui
- **3D Visualizations**: Three.js with React Three Fiber
- **Testing**: Vitest

## Project Structure

The page is structured to build trust through transparency:

1. **Hero Section**: Clear introduction to what Emireq is and isn't
2. **Money Flow Visualization**: Interactive 2D and 3D diagrams showing how money moves
3. **Risk Transparency**: Custom risk dial component for honest risk assessment
4. **Audience Matrix**: Who the investment is for and not for
5. **Call to Action**: Soft invitation to learn more

## Why This Structure?

The layout follows a logical flow from introduction to trust-building elements, using visual explanations over text-heavy marketing. The custom risk transparency dial provides an interactive way to understand risks without overwhelming the user. Sections are designed to be scannable, with honest language that avoids hype.

## One Thing to Improve with More Time

With more time, I would add accessibility features like ARIA labels for screen readers, keyboard navigation for interactive components, and color contrast optimizations to ensure the page is usable for all users.
